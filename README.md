<p style="color:#5E5E5E;font-weight:bold;">ML Based Mental Health Diagnosis & Consulting App</p>
</div>

---

#### Idea in brief
MindCrafter is a mental health diagnosis application that uses data from android smartphones, smartwatches that automatically measure patterns of behavior. Real-time smart devices data measurement provides a complete picture of behavioral functioning. This helps MindCrafter to provide Dynamic AI tailored diagnosis and consulting to each person.

##### Working Explanation
I am primarily focusing on the five most important mental issues. 2 out of 5 adults have these issues. I'll be using Smart devices with Android OS to collect behavioral data like sleep times & heart rate of the user.
##### Anxiety (Excessive Fear)
Physical Symtoms|Data Collection Methods|
|--|--|
|Pelpetations (Sudden Heart Rate Fluctuations)|Heart Rate Monitoring<br>using SmartWatch or Facial Recognition
|Sudden Fluctuations in Body Tempreture|Body Temperature Monitoring<br/>using SmartWatch or device's built-in temperature sensor|
|Involuntary Tremors in body| Symptom Analysis Questioning<br/>using Application Notifications|
|Voluntary Tremors|Voluntary Leg or Hand Shaking<br/>using Motion sensors|
|Issues with Stomach (Digestion)|Symptom Analysis Questioning<br/>using Application Notifications|
###### Android Based treatments: Meditation, Entertainment, Therapy Session, etc.

##### Depression (Feeling Upset)

|Physical Symtoms|Data Collection Methods|
|--|--|
|Loose of Interest in Social & Entertainment Activities |Relaxation Time<br>Time Spend on Social & Entertainment Media|
|Excessive Guilt Feelings|Therapy Session Analysis<br/>using Therapy Questioning in Application|
|Sudden Low Physical work & Excersize|Meditation, Yoga & Physical Activity Tracker<br/>using Application & SmartWatch|
|Sleep Abnormalities (Early Wakeups & Disturbed Sleep Patterns)|Sleep Tracking<br/>using SmartWatch & Device usage|
|Poor Concentration|Symptom Analysis Questioning<br/>using Application Notifications|
###### Android Based treatments: Therapy Session, ANT clearing Therapy, etc.

##### Bipolar Disorder (Severe Mental Disorder)
This type of disorder can be analyzed with mania & Depression together. Because of this mental issue. The user always switch between Mania Phase & Depression Phase for 7 t0 15 days for each Phase.
##### Mania (Depression is discussed above)
|Physical Symtoms|Data Collection Methods|
|--|--|
|Sudden Excessive Interest in Social & Entertainment Activities |Activity Time<br>Time Spend on Social & Entertainment Media|
|Excessive Happiness Feelings|Therapy Session Analysis<br/>using Therapy Questioning in Application|
|Sudden increase in Energy Levels, Physical work & Excersize|Meditation, Yoga & Physical Activity Tracker<br/>using Application & SmartWatch|
|Very fewer Sleep Patterns with high energy levels|Sleep Tracking<br/>using SmartWatch & Device usage|
|Grandeur Feeling|Symptom Analysis Questioning<br/>using Application Notifications|
###### Android Based treatments: Long Therapy Sessions, Specialised Consultancy, etc.



##### 187 More Issues with Symptoms and Data Collection Method can be analyzed for ML Model training.

#### Product & Features
Each user generates more than 100+ behavioral data points each day. Which can help MindCrafter to analyze the situation of the user. Today users are digitizing more personal data than ever before. 

|Product|Features|
|--|--|
|Android Application|Consulting ChatBot|
||Medidation Guide (Full)|
||Daily Yoga Scheduling|
||Emotional State Monitoring|
|Google Assistant (Service)|Consulting ChatBot|
||Guided Meditation Session(Quick)|

#### Project Technology Profile
|Frameworks|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Flutter | Android Application Development|
|Firebase | Performance & Monitoring|
|Tensorflow Lite | On Device tailored ML Model|
|Dialogflow | Consulting Bot|
|Google API's | Youtube Videos & Music|

#### Google’s help

- I've got a very limited understanding of feature extraction from behavioral data for ML model training that is different for each user. Google could help me with a better understanding of the Android OS & Data Collection methods that I can use. 
- Google could help with Google API's integration like Youtube API & Music API.
- This application could impact thousands of people but with Google, it can impact millions of people who don't even know that they need help.

#### Plan on using On-Device ML technology
On-device APIs can process your data quickly and work even when there’s no network connection. Cloud-based APIs, on the other hand, leverage the power of Google Cloud Platform's machine learning technology to give you an even higher level of accuracy.

|On Device ML Kit API's|Use Cases (examples)|
|--|--|
|Text recognition|Language Processing & Conversation Engine|
|Face detection| Facial Emotion & Heart rate Tracking|
|Object detection & tracking| AR Based Meditation Guide|
|Smart Reply| ChatBot Reply Helper|
|AutoML model inference|On-device ML inference|
|Custom model inference|On-device ML inference|

#### Project Timeline 

|Start Date| End date| Milestones|
|---|---|---|
|2 April|29 April| Study about digital diagnosis|
|1 May| 18 May | Planning about ML integration|
|19 May| 2 June | Analysis Modelling|
|3 June| 23 June | Development (Templates & Operations)|
|24 June| 3 July | Tensorflow lite Integration|
|4 July | 20 July | Machine Learning Training & Debugging|
|23 July | 3 August | Functional Testing|
|4 August | 20 August | User Interface Designing|
|21 August | 31 August | User Experience Testing|
|Final Deployment 1 September| Deployment & Testing|

#### Why Mental Problems ?

###### National Alliance on Mental Illness Report -  Sept. 2019 

    1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year
    1 in 25 U.S. adults experience serious mental illness each year
    1 in 6 U.S. youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year
    Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among people aged 10-34 

    There is only one psychiatrist per 100 000 people
